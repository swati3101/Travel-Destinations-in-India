<h1><u> Top 10 Adventure Destinations in India</u></h1></p>

India is a land of massive adventure opportunities. Across the length and breadth of the country one is able to find multiple opportunities to plunge in the 
activities that not only instigate adrenaline rush but also transcend one to the world of fearlessness. However, there are some activities and there are a few 
places that fit like a glove, which means when a right adventure sport is attempted at a right destination, the fun and thrill multiplies. Here are some 
outdoor adventure hacks that you must reach out for on your trip in India.  
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>1. Walk over the Frozen Lake at Zanskar Valley, Ladakh :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
There can be nothing better than can give you the adrenaline rush than the Chadar Trek. It is the reckoned to be the Mother of all treks and has a big name 
when it comes to best treks in India. Everything about this frozen trail trek is unique: the scenery, temperature, atmosphere, the frozen river, sledges, 
unusual camp sites, caves and the ever changing Chadar. It is so unique that it has to be experienced!
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>2. Hang Upside Down in Air at Rishikesh, Uttarakhand :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
Have you imagined what it would be to drop down from a platform placed 83m above the ground and the hang upside down in the middle of everything? Well, it sent
a chill down my spine and for those who know what it takes to a single Bungee Jump, certainly realizes that the adventure of Bunjee Jumping can in no way go 
wrong. Provoke the adventure devil in you and enjoy this outdoor adventure in India.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>3. Swim with Water Giants at Havelock Islands, Andaman :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
The deep clean water and gorgeous marine life makes Andaman one of the most fascinating destinations for scuba diving in India. These islands has several 
diving sites that offer vast variety of marine animals such as Scorpion fish, Octopus, Angler fish, Sharks and Coral reefs. Havelock Islands in Andaman is 
probably the coolest site to scuba dive and snorkel, swimming with the water giants is certainly one of those memories that cannot be erased.

Dive sites:
<ol type="disc" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:20px;">
<li>The Wall ( Havelock Island)</li>
<li>Clinque Island ( Port Blair)</li>
<li>Fish Rock (Passage island)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>4. Soar Like an Eagle in the Sky of Mysore, Karnataka  :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
When Anthony Hopkins in his 60’s attempts a sky dive in the movie Bucketlist, I realized that life is about living on the edge. We all should have a bucketlist
and it should have skydiving in it for sure. As far as skydiving in India is considered, Mysore is the name that tops the chart. Offering best facilities and 
amenities, the skydiving camps provide the option of tandem jumps, static jumps and accelerated freefalls prior to professional training for 2 – 3 days to 
ensure all kinds of safety. So, Mysore is the place and skydiving is the next activity on your adventure list in India.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>5. Tame the Rapids at Tons Valley, Uttarakhand :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
There is Ganga in Rishikesh with its tricky Daniel’s Dip and then there is Zanskar River in Ladakh with its difficult rapids but what catches the eye in the 
recent is Tons River in West Uttarakhand. The river offers Grade IV rapids, which are enough to get attention of expert rafters from round the world.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>6. Get the Bird’s Eye View of the Royale Jaipur :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
Hot Air Ballooning is probably one of the best ways to explore the royal beauty of Jaipur. Getting a bird’s eye view of this royal masterpiece is probably 
one of the best feelings that you can relish forever from your India visit memories. The excitement of flying over palaces, forts and lakes is quite special 
and beholding these fantastic sights and capturing them in your camera to cherish later is the ideal thing to do. These rides are arranged early in the morning
and late afternoon as during this period the winds are quite favourable for this activity.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>7. Put the World under Your Feet at Bir Billing  :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="bir.jpg" alt="Bir"></img></p>

<p>
Soar high in the sky of Bir Billing in Himachal Pradesh. The two destinations offer an incredible opportunity to glide above the verdant mountains and behold 
sites like never before. Bir Billing has a league of trained instructors that ensure proper training for solo flights without having to miss out on fun.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>8. Jet the Sea on a Flyboard at Goa :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="goa.jpg" alt="Flyboard at Goa"></img></p>

<p>
Comparatively a new watersport in India, flyboard is made available in Baina Beach of Goa. The sport most enjoyed by youngsters is done on a jet ski that 
seems to be attached by a hose that pumps water to send it as high as 15 metres in the air, enabling the rider to make dolphin-like maneuvers and dive under 
water from a great height. Allowing swirling, flipping and rising high in the water, fly board is indeed a great way to have fun in the waters of Goa.
</p>


<p>
<h2><u>9.  Motorbike to World’s Highest Mountain Pass at Ladakh :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="motor.jpg" alt="Ladakh"></img></p>

<p>
India is a land of unbelievable places and motor biking through them is an experience that cannot be experienced anywhere. One such incredible motor biking 
destination is Khardung La, the highest motorable road in the world. Situated at the height of 5359m above the sea level, this high pass is enough to get your 
adrenaline run crazy.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>10. Explore the Caves in Meghalaya :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="caves.jpg" alt="Caves"></img></p>

<p>
The state of Meghalaya is probably the best places to go caving in India. These lesser frequented caves offer incredible thrill to the spelunkers who visit 
from around the globe. If these deep, dark and watery caves cannot grab attention then I do not know what will!
