<h1><u> Top 10 Night-life Destinations in India</u></h1></p>
<p>
“Nightlife comes out of a bottle and goes into a jar“, rightly said, Ernest Hemingway.
From college students to corporate slaves (excuse the hyperbole) and middle-aged patrons, party-lovers come in all sizes. Some like to frequent dance clubs 
(and take too many shots); some just want to unwind in shaam with a jaam, most stay up all night to “get some”, and some like to enjoy “dinner and a movie”. 
Everybody wants to let loose, especially on weekends, whether you’re a hardcore boozer or someone’s designated driver.

Here’s the ten liveliest cities in India to paint it red tonight. 
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>1. Mumbai(Bombay) :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
If you’re thinking why Mumbai is placed at the top, then most likely you haven’t experienced its legendary nightlife. Mumbai has a certain vitality more than 
any other place in India. From Andheri West to all the way up to Cuffe Parade, there is something around every corner to dance, drink and burp. Colaba and Kala
Ghoda neighbourhoods provide the most diverse choices and many Bollywood celebs casually hang out in Bandra and Juhu. For an entertaining-cum-thrilling 
experience, throw your money away (well, not literally) in dance bars of Borivali.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>2. Anjuna and Panjim, Goa :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
Be it on a beach or in a hotel garden, having parties is a local ritual all of us must perform. Whether it’s the New Year celebrations, seasonal international 
festivals, or live concerts, Goa throbs relentlessly. For full moon trance parties, head to Anjuna’s shoreline, Calangute Beach, Baga town, and Colva, whereas 
Vagator is famed for rave parties. Panjim (Panaji) also boasts unabridged nightlife clubbing, shoreline parties, and jazz shows.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>3. Delhi NCR :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
Don’t hesitate to let your hair down in Delhi; when you’re with a right crowd at the right place, endless gratification is guaranteed. While private farmhouse 
is the way to roll in Gurgaon, discotheques (discs) are preferred options around Noida. Hauz Khas Village, Greater Kailash, and Connaught Place in Delhi are 
dotted with nightclubs, rooftop bars, themed restaurants, and more.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>4. Banglore  :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
Bangaloreans follows a simple mantra: work hard and play harder. No Limmits, Pebble – the Jungle Lounge, Skyye, Opus, High Ultra Lounge, and Loveshack are the
most happening hang-outs where party-hoppers make all sorts of revelry. The city has a swanky night scene with more than 200 watering holes where you can pick
up the tab for a friend or maybe a stranger.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>5. Pune :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
Puneites love to party, period. It is one of the few cities in India where night-spots are open even after midnight. Mainly, the young populace (students and 
IT-youth) is the driving force behind thriving club culture here. High Spirits, Mi A Mi, Area 51, and Stone Water Grill are hot spots for entertainment with 
live DJs and dance floors. The Hard Rock Café in Pune plays signature classics and serves American burgers.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>6. Hyderabad :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
The city of Nizams comes alive once the sun sets on the Charminar. With a cocktail of tradition and modernism, the city offers several pubs, discs, and clubs 
for usual party-goers. Anything from remixed pop songs to ultra electronic dance tracks blast from speakers in clubs of Banjara Hills. Bottles & Chimney, 
Liquids, The Club at Novotel, and 10 Downing Street add lustre to Hyderabad’s buzzing night scene.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>7. Kolkata :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
The up-and-coming nightlife in Kolkata may not outshine its rich tapestry of culture. Nevertheless, don’t let it hold you back. Tantra, which revolutionized 
the clubbing scene in its heyday, remains among the most crowded places on weekends. Feel the 60s retro glamour at Roxy, relish with live music and ice-cold 
beer at Someplace Else, and check out the newest and swankiest club named The Myx.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>8. Shillong :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="nightshillong.jpg" alt="Shillong"></img></p>

<p>
With live music and passionate people, there is no dearth of nightlife in the capital of Meghalaya. Come weekends, when the party bug bites, night-owls throng 
at Tango, Cloud 9 at Hotel Centre Point, or Platinum at Hotel Polo Towers, which play peppy music and have dance floors. And if all the stars align rightly, 
you might just catch a performance by the local icon Lou Majaw.
</p>


<p>
<h2><u>9.  Pondicherry(Pudducherry) :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="nightpondicherry.jpg" alt="Pondicherry"></img></p>

<p>
Although the town is not as lively as other metro cities in India, few people can turn down a tempting ménage-à-trois of booze, bonfires, and beaches. Steeped 
in French heritage, it is one of those places where you can be as quiet as you need or act as crazy as you want. While romantic ones can take a walk on the 
tree-lined boulevards, the party animals can dance the night away in Asian House discotheque.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>10. Chandigarh :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
To feel the spirit of the boogie or to raise the roof with bhangra beats, Chandigarh does it best. In the evening, stroll past sculptures at Rock Garden and 
then head to Lava bar, Tao Lounge, Antidote, and Oriental lounge to have a night-out. Visit English-themed Peddlers’ Pub and Hops n Grains (in Panchkula) where
 Chandigarh residents like to unwind.
