</p>
<p>

<p>
India is a diverse country steeped in history. Its past has seen a melting pot of different religions, rulers and empires -- all of which have left their mark 
on the countryside. Many historical places in India are listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites due to their cultural importance.One of the Seven Wonders of the 
World, the Taj Mahal is undoubtedly India's most famous monument. It looms evocatively from the banks of the Yamuna River. Mughal emperor Shah Jahan had it 
built as a mausoleum for third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631. Construction took place over 16 years, from 1632 to 1648.The Taj Mahal is made out of 
white marble but its color captivatingly appears to gradually alter in the changing light of the day.

<p>
<h2><u>2. Hampi :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
Now a laid back village in northern Karnataka, Hampi was once the last capital of Vijayanagar, one of the greatest Hindu empires in India’s history. Muslim 
invaders conquered the city in 1565, wreaking destruction and reducing it to ruins. It was pillaged and then abandoned. Hampi has some captivating ruins, 
intriguingly intermingled with large boulders that rear up all over the landscape. The ruins date back to the 14th century and stretch for just over 25 
kilometers (10 miles). They comprise more than 500 monuments, including magnificent Dravidian temples and palaces.  An incredible energy can be felt at this 
ancient place.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>3. Fatehpur Sikhri :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
Fatehpur Sikri, near Agra in Uttar Pradesh, was once the proud but short-lived capital of the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. Emperor Akbar founded the 
city from the twin villages of Fatehpur and Sikri in 1569, as tribute to famous Sufi saint Sheikh Salim Chishti. The saint accurately predicted the birth of 
Emperor Akbar's much longed for son.Not long after Fatehpur Sikri was completed, it unfortunately had to be abandoned by its occupants as the water supply was 
insufficient. Nowadays, the city is a deserted ghost town (albeit one that's overrun with beggars and touts) with well-preserved Mughal architecture. Monuments
include an imposing entrance gate, one of India's largest mosques, and a palace complex.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>4. Jallianwala Bagh  :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="jallianwala.jpg" alt="Jallianwala bagh"></img></p>

<p>
Jallianwala Bagh, near the Golden Temple in Amritsar, is the site of a sad but defining moment in India's history and struggle for freedom. On April 13, 1919, 
British troops opened fire on a large group of more than 10,000 unarmed protesters, in what is known as the Amritsar Massacre.The British didn't give any 
warning of the shooting. Official records indicate that about 400 people were killed and another 1,200 injured. The unofficial tally is much higher though. 
Many people died in stampedes and by jumping into a well to escape being shot.The horrific massacre was a turning point in India's relations with the British 
and a driving factor in Gandhi's movement to seek Independence from British rule.

<h2><u>5. Gateway of India :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
Mumbai's most recognizable monument, the Gateway of India, occupies a commanding position overlooking the Arabian Sea at the harbor in Colaba. It was built 
commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary's to the city in 1911. However, it wasn't completed until 1924.The Gateway of India subsequently played 
an significant part in India's history. The last British troops departed through it in 1948, when India obtained Independence
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>6. Red Fort :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="redfort.jpg" alt="Red Fort"></img></p>

<p>
Neglected and in disrepair in parts, Delhi's Red Fort may not be as impressive as some forts in India but it certainly has a distinguished history.The fort was
built as a palace by fifth Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan, when he shifted his capital from Agra to Delhi in 1638. The capital, known as Shahjahanabad, was where 
Old Delhi is today. Much of the development took place around Chandni Chowk, the chaotic and crumbling market area adjoining the Red Fort.The Mughals occupied 
the fort for almost 200 years, until it was lost to the British in 1857.  When India obtained Independence on August 15, 1947, the first Prime Minister of 
India (Jawahar Lal Nehru) unfurled the Indian flag from the fort's ramparts. This practice still continues every Independence Day, when India's Prime Minister 
hoists the Indian flag and gives a speech there.

<p>
<h2><u>7. Khajuraho Temples  :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="khajuraho.jpg" alt="Khajuraho"></img></p>

<p>
If you want proof that the Kama Sutra originated in India, Khajuraho is the place to see. Erotica abounds here with over 20 temples devoted to sexuality and 
sex. The temples were built mostly between 950 and 1050 by rulers of the Chandela dynasty of Rajputs, which made Khajuraho their first capital. They were 
hidden for centuries, surrounded by dense jungle, until the British rediscovered them in the early 19th century.The temples are best known for their erotic 
sculptures. However, more than that, they show a celebration of love, life and worship. They also provide an uninhibited and unusual peek into ancient Hindu 
faith and Tantric practices.Apparently, the temples were used actively until the end of the 12th century, after which time Khajuraho was attacked and seized by
Muslim invaders. The remaining temples are now a UNESCO World Heritage site.

<p>
<h2><u>8. Ajanta and Ellora Caves :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
The Ajanta and Ellora caves are astonishingly carved into hillside rock in the middle of nowhere in Maharashtra.There are 34 caves at Ellora, dating back to 
between the 6th and 11th centuries AD. They're an interesting and notable mix of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain religions. This comes from their construction at a 
time when Buddhism was waning in India and Hinduism was starting to reassert itself. Most of the work at Ellora, including the astonishing Kailasa Temple, was 
overseen by Chalukya and Rashtrakuta kings. Towards the end of building period, local rulers switched their allegiance to the Digambara sect of Jainism.The 30 
caves at Ajanta are Buddhist caves that were constructed in two phases, in the 2nd century BC and 6th century AD.While the Ajanta caves are rich in paintings 
and sculpture, the Ellora caves are renowned for their extraordinary architecture. The most incredible thing about these caves is that they were crafted by 
hand, with only a hammer and chisel.

<p>
<h2><u>9. Rani ki Vav(The Queen's Stepwell)  :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
A surprisingly recent archaeological find in Patan, Gujarat, Rani ki Vav was flooded by the nearby Saraswati River and silted over until the late 1980s. The 
step well, which is undoubtedly India's most awe-inspiring, dates back to the 11th century during the reign on the Solanki dynasty. Apparently, the widow of 
ruler Bhimdev I had it built in his memory.The step well was designed as an inverted temple. Its panels are evocatively covered in more than 500 main 
sculptures and 1,000 minor ones. Incredibly, no stone is left un-carved!
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>10. Old Goa  :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
Located 10 kilometers from Panjim, the historic city of Old Goa was the capital of Portuguese India from the 16th century until the 18th century. It had a 
substantial population of more than 200,000 people but was abandoned due to the plague. The Portuguese relocated to Panjim, which is known for its Latin 
Quarter filled with colorful Portuguese homes.Old Goa was actually founded in the 15th century, before the Portuguese, by rulers of the Bijapur Sultanate. 
After the Portuguese captured it, they constructed many churches. The most notable ones standing today are the Basilica of Bom Jesus (which contains the 
mortal remains of Saint Francis Xavier), Se Cathedral (the seat of the Archbishop of Goa), and the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi.
