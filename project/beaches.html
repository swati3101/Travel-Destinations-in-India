<h1><u> Top 10 Beaches in India</u></h1></p>
<p>
According to Forbes, you can forget the beaches of Ibiza, Rio, or even Australia. These days, India's beaches are where it's all happening. It's true that 
India does have some incredibly scenic beaches that offer everything from action to solitude, and of course parties. The best India beaches can be found on 
the west coast. Here's where to look.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>1. Varkala Beach :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<highlight1>
<i><b>‘Best Spectacular Setting’</b></i>
</highlight1></p>
<p>
Stunning Varkala beach lies around one hour north of capital Trivandrum in Kerala, and provides a relatively peaceful alternative to the now commercialized 
Kovalam. The setting of this beach is striking enough to take your breath away, with a long paved stretch of cliff bordered by shacks and views that extend 
over the Arabian Sea. It's an excellent place to rest and rejuvenate, with yoga and Ayurveda being popular there.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>2. Gokarna Beach :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<highlight1>
<i><b>‘Best Secluded Beach’</b></i>
</highlight1></p>
<p>
Gokarna is a small and remote holy town in northern Karnataka, with four of India's most secluded and pristine beaches nestled nearby. It draws both pious 
pilgrims and hedonistic holiday makers with equal enthusiasm. Go there to get a feel for what Goa was like in its heyday, although time is limited as 
developers are already seeing the potential of this area.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>3. Palolem Beach :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<highlight1>
<i><b>‘Best Picturesque Beach ’</b></i>
</highlight1></p>
<p>
Picturesque Palolem Beach, enclosed by a thick forest of coconut palms in far south Goa, is arguably the state's most beautiful beach. This mile long, shady, 
semi-circle shaped beach continues to grow in popularity every year, and it's become very lively with the diverse crowd that it attracts.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>4. Tarkarli :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="tarkarli.jpg" alt="tarkarli"></img></p>

<p>
<highlight1>
<i><b>‘Best Beach for scuba diving and Snorkeling’</b></i>
</highlight1></p>
<p>
If you can't make it to the Andaman Islands, the area around Tarkarli beach in southern Maharashtra has one of the best coral reefs on the Indian mainland. 
\Relatively untouched by development, this beach is not on the tourist trail and still retains a village feel complete with homestay accommodations right on 
the beach. Locals can often be seen unhurriedly riding bicycles or walking to get around.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>5. Agonda Beach :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="agonda.jpg" alt="Agonda"></img></p>

<p>
<highlight1>
<i><b>‘Best Beach for Doing nothing’</b></i>
</highlight1></p>
<p>
Long, serene Agonda Beach in south Goa is perfect for those looking to get away from it all. Stay in a simple hut right on the beach, and enjoy the stillness 
and nature. The rear of the beach is lined with shacks and small shops but apart from that, there's not much else to do apart from eat, drink, swim, and chill.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>6. Arambol Beach :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="arambol.jpg" alt="arambol"></img></p>

<p>
<highlight1>
<i><b>‘Best Beach for Hippies and musicians’</b></i>
</highlight1></p>
<p>
Arambol, on Goa's far northern stretch of coastline, has become the new hippie haven. Once a small fishing village, it's now full of long term travelers. 
You'll find plenty of alternative therapies there, such as meditation, yoga, tai chi, and reiki.  The nightlife is relaxed, with live music and jam sessions 
happening on the beach.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>7. Mandrem Beach :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="mandrem.jpg" alt="Mandrem"></img></p>

<p>
<highlight1>
<i><b>‘Best Trendy Beach’</b></i>
</highlight1></p>
<p>
The wide open beaches of Ashvem, Mandrem and Morjim, located in a line next to each other in north Goa, have become quite hip and trendy in recent years. 
Groovy beach bars, restaurants, shops, beach huts and fashionable resorts can be found there. Sunset Ashram is one of Goa's best bars. The area also has a 
number yoga retreats and some of the best beach huts.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>8. Baga Beach :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<highlight1>
<i><b>‘Best Commercial Beach’</b></i>
</highlight1></p>
<p>
For sure, Baga Beach in north Goa may be touristy and busy but for those who like action, it’s one of the most happening beaches on the coast. Water sports, 
para sailing, dolphin sightseeing trips, beach shacks, bars, clubs, and fine dining restaurants -- you’ll find them all there!
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>9. Kovalam Beach :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>
<img src="lighthouse.jpg" alt="Kovalam"></img></p>

<p>
<highlight1>
<i><b> ‘Best Beach with Lighthouse'</b></i>
</highlight1></p>
<p>
The most developed of Kerala's beaches, Kovalam is located not far from Trivandrum. It's made up of two coves -- Hawa (also referred to as Eve's beach) and 
Lighthouse. Lighthouse is the biggest and busiest of the two, with its promenade lined with open air restaurants. The lighthouse atop this beach provides 
fantastic views, especially at sunset. If you'd prefer somewhere a little more secluded, you'll find nearby Samudra beach to be a better option. Kovalam is 
also one of the best beaches in India for surfing.
</p>

<p>
<h2><u>10. Radhanagar Beach, Havelock Island :</u></h2>
</p>
<p>

<i><b>‘Best Remote Beach’ </b></i>
</highlight1></p>
<p>
Once voted Asia's Best Beach by TIME Magazine, Radhanagar Beach is situated on Havelock Island in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which are sprinkled across 
the Bay of Bengal. The islands are a Union Territory of India. Radhanagar Beach (also referred to as beach number seven) is renowned for its calm, still water 
and fine white sand.
